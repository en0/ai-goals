# Maze Game

This is the first task I gave myself. It's not really AI, just a POC for the screengrab and sendkeys
classes.

## Solve a maze

1. Open your browser to [mathsisfun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/mazes.html)
2. Start a new maze. only mini, easy, medium are currently working.
3. Run the maze_game.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m maze_game
```

Note, you need to have the browser approximatly in the middle of your primary monitor. If you run
into trouble, try minimizing unrelated windows. Make sure the browser has focus before the maze_game
starts to send keys.

## Notes

My next goal is to make this code work with different sizes of mazes.
