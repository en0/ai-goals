# AI Goals

Just playing around with bots.

This is just some hacked together stuff to play around with bots that play games through the same
interface as humans do.  Screen grabs, keystrokes, and mouse clicks. Just seeing what I can do.

## Quick start

Create a virtual environment and install the requirements

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To do anything useful, go poke through the subdirectories (like `maze_game`).
