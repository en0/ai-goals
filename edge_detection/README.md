# Edge Detect

This is my first attempt at edge detection. what i have is sub-optimal. I need to do more reading
but this does atleast work, mostly.

## Solve a maze

1. Open your browser to [mathsisfun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/mazes.html)
2. Start a new maze. hard or wide is best.
3. Run the edge_detection

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m edge_detection
```
